Whatsapp media manager

Arranges whatsapp media (images for now) into separate folders for each chat.

I find it difficult to delete whatsapp images as there will be something interesting or needed in it. Hence I backup the data, but backed up data is a mess since we can't find out which image belonged to which chat. This is an attempt to fix that.
